# TopPHP2 - The ultimate API wrapper for [top.gg](https://top.gg/)
**TopPHP2** is the __unofficial__ successor of [TopPHP](https://github.com/top-gg/php-sdk).

See [here](/docs.md) for the official information.

## Installation
TopPHP uses composer to download. In order to install the library, use the following line:

`composer require foxworn3365/topphp`

## Why the library's namespace is `TopPHP` and not `TopPHP2`?
Good question dear detective-programmer friend, simply because the namespace of the former library (TopPHP) is not `\TopPHP` but rather `\DBL` therefore we take advantage of it ðŸ˜Ž

## Coming Soon
* Forced library global rate-limiting.
